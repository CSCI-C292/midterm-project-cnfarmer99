This is a 2D puzzle game.  A player will move objects into the designated areas in order to proceed to the next level.  

Assets:
    Keys:
        This is Gerald.

        These are my keys.

        CC0, free to use. I'd appreciate a shout-out, but it isn't necessary at all.

        I did all the keys I felt like doing, so I included some blank ones in case I forgot something, or if you're using a different keyboard or special characters.

        Thank you for using Gerald's keys.

        I changed them a bit just to make them a little easier to use in the scene and also used a blank key to make both the "goal zone" and the player sprites. 


    Background:
        Created by me in Krita.

    Text:
        I used a textpackage from a project for another class.


Goals:

    11/18:  COMPLETE
        Make esc key functional- finished
        Create collision objects on esc sprite- finished
        
        Extra:
            I made collision objects on the key sprites so the player can't move over them.
            I added rigid bodies to player for the physics, but couldn't figure out player movement.
            I also added collision body to player and made esc sprite and player and goal triggers.
            Made a disclaimer about going off screen on menu because honestly don't feel like messing with making a boarder at this current point.
            I turned off gravity so that way when you get to the second level the sprite doesn't fall off screen like it was. 

    12/2 - 12/9: COMPLETE
        Make esc sprite moveable; when in correct area it activates
        Player movement on all levels
        Fix Text for all scenes

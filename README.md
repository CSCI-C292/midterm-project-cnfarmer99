This is a 2D puzzle game.  A player will move objects into the designated areas in order to proceed to the next level.  

Assets:
    Keys:
        This is Gerald.

        These are my keys.

        CC0, free to use. I'd appreciate a shout-out, but it isn't necessary at all.

        I did all the keys I felt like doing, so I included some blank ones in case I forgot something, or if you're using a different keyboard or special characters.

        Thank you for using Gerald's keys.

        I changed them a bit just to make them a little easier to use in the scene and also used a blank key to make both the "goal zone" and the player sprites.

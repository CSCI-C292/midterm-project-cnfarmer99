This is a 2D puzzle game.  A player will move objects into the designated areas in order to proceed to the next level.

        This is Gerald.

        These are my keys.

        CC0, free to use. I'd appreciate a shout-out, but it isn't necessary at all.

        I did all the keys I felt like doing, so I included some blank ones in case I forgot something, or if you're using a different keyboard or special characters.

        Thank you for using Gerald's keys.

Goals:

    10/21:
        -Create 2 menu scenes and 3 level scenes (done)
        -Add necessary assets to levels (done)
        -Make 2 menus work as expected (have 3)
        
    10/28:
        -Levels 1 and 2 working as expected
        -Need to figure out animated sprites
            -Level One:
                -Player moves esc key into needed area to move to next level and doesn't work prior
                -WASD aren't moveable this level
            -Level Two:
                -Player moves esc key into needed area to move to next level and doesn't work prior
                -WASD skewed and have to be moved in order to "fix" controls
                -Placement of WASD sprites is off, player must move them in order to get esc key to needed area
        -Want buttons, text, etc to grow/shrink with user screen

    11/4:
        -Level 3 working fully:
            -Player moves esc key into needed area to move to next level and doesn't work prior
            -WASD keys inverted so controls are inverted
                -WASD aren't moveable this level
        -If there's time work on stretched goals:
            -Player can't move to next level even if esc key in needed area unless all tasks completed
                -Only necessary on Level 2 for getting all WASD keys at least in highlighted spots or in correct spots
            -Add hidden interactable objs in each level
                -different in every level
                    -Level 1:
                        -move a piece of text and collect a coin hidden underneath
                    -Level 2:
                        -move piece of text and auto complete level and auto start Level 3
                    -Level 3:
                        -bump a piece of text and a little animation happens in corner of screen? Not sure for this level yet.
